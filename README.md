## Background of the Study 🏢

The Bacoor City Livelihood and Development Office plays a pivotal role in providing essential services to local businesses through the Negosyo Center. However, clients often face challenges accessing and understanding the array of services offered. Recognizing the need for a more accessible and user-friendly information platform, this research focuses on developing an Information Kiosk for inquiry purposes.

The tablet-based kiosk, utilizing HTML and Bootstrap technologies, aims to streamline the process of obtaining information about the Negosyo Center’s services. It serves as a digital guide, offering details on services such as DTI business name registration, renewals, affirmative/negative certification requests, and support for micro-enterprises. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of client inquiries.

By introducing this digital solution, the project addresses the specific needs of clients seeking information and aims to streamline the inquiry process at the Bacoor City Livelihood and Development Office. This study explores the rationale client experience and contributes to the modernization of local administrative services. Through the integration of user-centric design and technology, the Information Kiosk strives to provide a convenient and informative resource for clients engaging with the Negosyo Center.

## Statement of the Problem ❓

### Main Problem ❗

The primary problem addressed by this research stems from the challenges faced by clients seeking information and clarification, especially when in doubt about the responses provided by receptionists. This uncertainty often results in long queues and extended handling times. Prior to ISO certification, the traditional method of displaying information through paper postings on the window proved ineffective, as clients often did not engage with or read the posted materials. Furthermore, the tablet, initially provided for displaying the citizen charter of the Bacoor City Livelihood Office, was underutilized and not employed to its full potential. The Information Kiosk project aims to transform this landscape by leveraging technology to create an accessible and efficient platform for client inquiries, thereby addressing the identified issues and enhancing the overall client experience at the Negosyo Center.

### Specific Problems ❗

- Clients are not actively engaging with the tablet provided at the Negosyo Center, leading to a missed opportunity to leverage technology for effective information dissemination.
- The tablet, initially intended for displaying the citizen charter, is not being utilized to its full potential, resulting in a lack of efficiency in addressing client inquiries and concerns.
- Traditional methods of displaying information through paper postings on the window are proving ineffective, as clients often do not interact with or comprehend the posted materials.
- The current approach of using paper postings fails to provide a user-friendly and accessible means of communication, contributing to long queues and extended handling times due to client uncertainty and lack of clarity.

## Objectives of the Study 🎯

### Main Objective 🌐

The primary objective of the Information Kiosk project is to optimize client experience at the Negosyo Center by addressing the underutilization of the tablet and inefficiency of posted materials. Through the seamless integration of technology, the goal is to establish an accessible and efficient platform that empowers clients with accurate information, reduces handling times, and minimizes uncertainty, thereby enhancing overall service delivery and satisfaction at the Bacoor City Livelihood Office.

### Specific Objectives 🌐

- The tablet provided at the Negosyo Center is underutilized, leading to a missed opportunity in leveraging technology for effective information dissemination.
- Lack of active engagement with the tablet results in a failure to optimize its potential for addressing client inquiries and concerns.
- Traditional paper postings on the window are inefficient in communicating information to clients, contributing prolonged handling times and client uncertainty.
- Ineffective communication through paper postings hinders the establishment of an optimal and seamless client-service interaction.
- The combined issues of underutilized technology and inefficient communication processes necessitate targeted interventions to enhance the overall client experience at the Bacoor City Livelihood Office.

## Scope and Limitation 🔍

### Scope of the Study 🔬

The scope of the Information Kiosk project is comprehensive, encompassing various aspects of the client-service interaction at the Negosyo Center. With a specific focus on resolving the identified issues of underutilized technology and inefficient communication, the study will delve into several key areas.

1. 💻 **Technology Integration:** Examination of the current state of tablet utilization, followed by the implementation of strategies to enhance engagement and utilization for more effective information dissemination.

2. 📜 **Communication Effectiveness:** Evaluation of existing methods such as traditional paper postings, along with the introduction of more efficient and user-friendly communication channels to reduce handling times and minimize client uncertainty.

3. 🤝 **User Experience Improvement:** Analysis of the overall client experience considering factors such as accessibility, clarity, and responsiveness. Measures will be implemented to enhance the user experience, ensuring accurate information delivery and fostering increased client satisfaction.

4. ⏱️ **Operational Efficiency:** Scrutiny of operational efficiency, assessing the impact of the Information Kiosk on overall efficiency. Implementation of streamlined processes aimed at reducing queues and handling times, thereby enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the Bacoor City Livelihood Office.

5. 🎓 **Training and Adoption:** Development of training programs for staff to effectively utilize and manage the Information Kiosk. Awareness promotion and encouragement initiatives will be implemented to encourage clients to engage with the new technology.

6. 🔄 **Feedback Mechanism:** Establishment of a Feedback Mechanism to continuously assess the effectiveness of the Information Kiosk. This iterative process will involve making improvements based on feedback, ensuring sustained enhancements in client-service interactions.

The study will be conducted exclusively within the confines of the Bacoor City Livelihood Office, with the overarching goal of transforming and optimizing current client service processes through the strategic implementation of technology and improved communication methods.

### Limitations of the Study ⚠️

In the pursuit of improving client-service interaction at the Negosyo Center through the Information Kiosk project, it is crucial to recognize several inherent limitations that may impact the study’s scope and applicability. Firstly, the focus solely on the Bacoor City Livelihood Office restricts the generalizability of findings to other locations or contexts. Additionally, time constraints may limit the depth of the study, particularly in understanding long-term effects and sustainability. Resource limitations, both financial and human, might impact the extent of technology integration and the execution of large-scale awareness campaigns.

Moreover, potential staff resistance or training gaps could affect the successful utilization of the Information Kiosk, influencing the overall project outcomes. The project's dependence on technology introduces the risk of technical issues or malfunctions, potentially disrupting the intended 🎯 objectives. Encouraging client adoption and engagement with the new technology may face challenges, impacting the Information Kiosk’s utilization. The feedback mechanism, while essential, may be subject to bias, as feedback providers may not represent the entire client population. Furthermore, external factors such as changes in government policies or economic conditions could influence the project’s success and its ability to achieve long-term objectives. Recognizing and addressing these limitations transparently will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the study’s outcomes, facilitating informed decision-making and refining strategies for client-service improvement at the Negosyo Center.
