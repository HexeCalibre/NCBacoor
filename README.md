# Developing Information Kiosk: An Innovative Project for Negosyo Center Bacoor

## Abstract 📝

This research paper explores the development of an innovative Information Kiosk tailored for the Bacoor City Livelihood and Development Office. Leveraging the capabilities of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and Bootstrap, the kiosk is specially designed for tablet devices, aiming to streamline and enhance various administrative processes related to business registration and development. The comprehensive content of the kiosk includes features such as DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) business name registration, renewal, certification requests, issuance of certified true copies, FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), cancellation procedures, business territorial scope upgrades, business name reconsideration, and support for barangay micro-business enterprises.

The primary beneficiary of this Information Kiosk is the Bacoor City Livelihood and Development Office. By implementing this technological solution, the office aims to improve efficiency, reduce processing times, and provide more accessible and user-friendly services for businesses operating within the city. This research contributes to the field by showcasing a practical application of web technologies in a government setting, highlighting the potential impact of user-centric design and technology adoption for administrative processes. The findings of this study may serve as a valuable reference for similar initiatives in other local government units, fostering a more technology-driven and responsive public service landscape.

## Chapter 1: The Problem and Its Background 📚

### Introduction 🌱

In the ever-evolving landscape of public service, technology plays a pivotal role in reshaping efficiency and accessibility. This research introduces an Information Kiosk crafted for the Bacoor City Livelihood and Development Office, leveraging HTML and Bootstrap. This tablet-friendly solution addresses intricate administrative processes tied to business registration.

# Chapter 1: The Problem and Its Background

## 1.1 Introduction

The Negosyo Center faces challenges in client interactions, necessitating the need for an Information Kiosk. The overarching problem is the underutilization of a government-issued tablet.

### Background of the Study 🌍

The current state of Negosyo Center operations reveals inefficiencies, and the tablet underutilization exacerbates these issues. The proposed Information Kiosk aims to address these challenges.

## 1.3 Statement of the Problem

Challenges faced by the City Livelihood and Development Office and tablet underutilization contribute to inefficiencies. Addressing these problems is crucial for streamlined client interactions.

### Statement of the Problem ❓

#### Main Problem

Optimize client experience at the Negosyo Center through Information Kiosk implementation.

#### Specific Problem

1. Resolve tablet installation challenges.
2. Improve Negosyo Center efficiency.
3. Align with ARTA and ISO standards.

### Objectives of the Study 🎯

#### Main Objective

The primary objective of the Information Kiosk project is to optimize the client experience at the Negosyo Center by addressing the underutilization of the tablet and the inefficiency of posted materials. Through the seamless integration of technology, the goal is to establish an accessible and efficient platform that empowers clients with accurate information, reduces handling times, and minimizes uncertainty, thereby enhancing overall service delivery and satisfaction at the Bacoor City Livelihood Office.

#### Specific Objectives

- The tablet provided at the Negosyo Center is underutilized, leading to a missed opportunity in leveraging technology for effective information dissemination.
- Lack of active engagement with the tablet results in a failure to optimize its potential for addressing client inquiries and concerns.
- Traditional paper postings on the window are inefficient in communicating information to clients, contributing to prolonged handling times and client uncertainty.
- Ineffective communication through paper postings hinders the establishment of an optimal and seamless client-service interaction.
- The combined issues of underutilized technology and inefficient communication processes necessitate targeted interventions to enhance the overall client experience at the Bacoor City Livelihood Office.

### Scope and Limitation 📌

#### Scope of the Study

The study's potential impacts on Negosyo Center operations extend to providing valuable insights for similar initiatives.

- Technology Integration: Examination of the current state of tablet utilization and implementation of strategies for enhancing engagement and utilization.
- Communication Effectiveness: Evaluation of existing methods such as traditional paper postings and introduction of more efficient communication channels.
- User Experience Improvement: Analysis of the overall client experience considering factors such as accessibility, clarity, and responsiveness, followed by measures to enhance it.
- Operational Efficiency: Assessment of the impact of the Information Kiosk on overall efficiency and implementation of streamlined processes.

#### Limitations of the Study

In the pursuit of improving client-service interaction at the Negosyo Center through the Information Kiosk project, it is crucial to recognize several inherent limitations that may impact the study’s scope and applicability.

- Focus solely on the Bacoor City Livelihood Office restricts the generalizability of findings to other locations or contexts.
- Time constraints may limit the depth of the study, particularly in understanding long-term effects and sustainability.
- Resource limitations, both financial and human, might impact the extent of technology integration and the execution of large-scale awareness campaigns.
- Staff resistance or training gaps could affect the successful utilization of the Information Kiosk, influencing the overall project outcomes.
- Dependence on technology introduces the risk of technical issues or malfunctions, potentially disrupting the intended objectives.

Recognizing and addressing these limitations transparently will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the study’s outcomes, facilitating informed decision-making and refining strategies for client-service improvement at the Negosyo Center.

### Theoretical Framework of the Study 🧠

The Information Kiosk project draws upon several theoretical foundations to guide its design, implementation, and analysis.

- **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM):** Guides the exploration of user attitudes, motivations, and behaviors towards the technology, ensuring its seamless integration into the client-service process.
- **Service Quality (SERVQUAL) Model:** Emphasizes the importance of service delivery in influencing customer satisfaction, guiding the assessment of factors such as accessibility, responsiveness, and accuracy.
- **Diffusion of Innovations Theory:** Guides the understanding of how new ideas or technologies are adopted and spread within a social system, helping tailor strategies for effective training, awareness promotion, and encouraging clients to engage with the new technology.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Principles:** Ensure the Information Kiosk’s design aligns with user expectations and promotes a positive user experience, aiming to minimize user errors, enhance information accessibility, and foster user satisfaction.

**BJ Fogg's Behavior Model Application:**

1. **Trigger:** Identify triggers that prompt users to interact with the Information Kiosk. Triggers can be external (e.g., signage, promotional materials) or internal (e.g., user needs, motivations).
2. **Ability:** Simplify the interaction process by ensuring the kiosk is easy to access and use. Design the interface with clear instructions, intuitive navigation, and minimal cognitive load to enhance user ability.
3. **Motivation:** Understand user motivations and tailor the kiosk's content and features to align with their needs and goals. Highlight benefits, incentives, or rewards for using the kiosk to increase motivation.

The overarching framework combines these theories, providing a comprehensive approach to address the underutilization of technology and inefficiency in communication at the Negosyo Center. By synthesizing these theoretical perspectives, the study aims to offer a robust foundation for the successful implementation and evaluation of the Information Kiosk project, with the ultimate goal of transforming and optimizing client service processes.
