## Statement of the Problem

### Main Problem

The primary problem addressed by this research stems from the challenges faced by clients seeking information and clarification, especially when in doubt about the responses provided by receptionists. This uncertainty often results in long queues and extended handling times. Prior to ISO certification, the traditional method of displaying information through paper postings on the window proved ineffective, as clients often did not engage with or read the posted materials. Furthermore, the tablet, initially provided for displaying the citizen charter of the Bacoor City Livelihood Office, was underutilized and not employed to its full potential. The Information Kiosk project aims to transform this landscape by leveraging technology to create an accessible and efficient platform for client inquiries, thereby addressing the identified issues and enhancing the overall client experience at the Negosyo Center.

### Specific Problems

1. üíº **Underutilization of Tablet:** Clients are not actively engaging with the tablet provided at the Negosyo Center, leading to a missed opportunity to leverage technology for effective information dissemination.

2. üì± **Tablet's Limited Potential:** The tablet, initially intended for displaying the citizen charter, is not being utilized to its full potential, resulting in a lack of efficiency in addressing client inquiries and concerns.

3. üóûÔ∏è **Ineffectiveness of Paper Postings:** Traditional methods of displaying information through paper postings on the window are proving ineffective, as clients often do not interact with or comprehend the posted materials.

4. ‚è≥ **Handling Time and Queue Issues:** The current approach of using paper postings fails to provide a user-friendly and accessible means of communication, contributing to long queues and extended handling times due to client uncertainty and lack of clarity.

## Objectives of the Study

Through the seamless integration of technology, the goal is to establish an accessible and efficient platform that empowers clients with accurate information, reduces handling times, and minimizes uncertainty, thereby enhancing overall service delivery and satisfaction at the Bacoor City Livelihood Office.

### Specific Objectives

1. üíª **Tablet Optimization:** Address the underutilization of the tablet by implementing strategies for effective information dissemination.

2. ü§ù **Improved Communication:** Enhance communication efficiency by evaluating existing methods and introducing more user-friendly channels to reduce handling times and minimize client uncertainty.

3. üåê **Enhanced User Experience:** Analyze the overall client experience, considering factors such as accessibility, clarity, and responsiveness. Implement measures to foster increased client satisfaction.

4. ‚è±Ô∏è **Operational Efficiency:** Scrutinize operational efficiency, assessing the impact of the Information Kiosk on overall efficiency. Implement streamlined processes aimed at reducing queues and handling times.

5. üéì **Staff Training and Adoption:** Develop training programs for staff to effectively utilize and manage the Information Kiosk. Implement awareness promotion initiatives to encourage clients to engage with the new technology.

6. üîÑ **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a Feedback Mechanism to continuously assess the effectiveness of the Information Kiosk. Make iterative improvements based on feedback, ensuring sustained enhancements in client-service interactions.

## Scope and Limitation

### Limitations of the Study

In the pursuit of improving client-service interaction at the Negosyo Center through the Information Kiosk project, it is crucial to recognize several inherent limitations that may impact the study‚Äôs scope and applicability. Firstly, the focus solely on the Bacoor City Livelihood Office restricts the generalizability of findings to other locations or contexts. Additionally, time constraints may limit the depth of the study, particularly in understanding long-term effects and sustainability. Resource limitations, both financial and human, might impact the extent of technology integration and the execution of large-scale awareness campaigns.

Moreover, potential staff resistance or training gaps could affect the successful utilization of the Information Kiosk, influencing the overall project outcomes. The project's dependence on technology introduces the risk of technical issues or malfunctions, potentially disrupting the intended objectives. Encouraging client adoption and engagement with the new technology may face challenges, impacting the Information Kiosk‚Äôs utilization. The feedback mechanism, while essential, may be subject to bias, as feedback providers may not represent the entire client population. Furthermore, external factors such as changes in government policies or economic conditions could influence the project‚Äôs success and its ability to achieve long-term objectives. Recognizing and addressing these limitations transparently will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the study‚Äôs outcomes, facilitating informed decision-making and refining strategies for client-service improvement at the Negosyo Center.

# Theoretical Framework of the Study

The Information Kiosk project draws upon several theoretical foundations to guide its design, implementation, and analysis. The integration of technology to enhance client-service interaction aligns with the principles of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). TAM posits that user acceptance and effective utilization of technology are influenced by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. In the context of the Information Kiosk, this theory guides the exploration of user attitudes, motivations, and behaviors towards the technology, ensuring its seamless integration into the client-service process.

The study is also informed by the Service Quality (SERVQUAL) model, which emphasizes the importance of service delivery in influencing customer satisfaction. By assessing factors such as accessibility, responsiveness, and accuracy, the project aims to enhance service quality at the Bacoor City Livelihood Office, ultimately contributing to improved client satisfaction.

Furthermore, the Diffusion of Innovations theory guides the understanding of how new ideas or technologies, such as the Information Kiosk, are adopted and spread within a social system. Recognizing the various stages of innovation adoption and the factors influencing this process helps tailor strategies for effective training, awareness promotion, and encouraging clients to engage with the new technology.

The study also considers aspects of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to ensure the Information Kiosk‚Äôs design aligns with user expectations and promotes a positive user experience. By incorporating HCI principles, the project aims to minimize user errors, enhance information accessibility, and foster user satisfaction.

The overarching framework combines these theories, providing a comprehensive approach to address the underutilization of technology and inefficiency in communication at the Negosyo Center. By synthesizing these theoretical perspectives, the study aims to offer a robust foundation for the successful implementation and evaluation of the Information Kiosk project, with the ultimate goal of transforming and optimizing client service processes.
